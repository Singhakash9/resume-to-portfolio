# Resume → Portfolio

This is not an advanced or heavily designed portfolio.

It is a simple, practical starting point for turning resume content into something that can be viewed and shared as a portfolio.

## Why I Built This

Most people already have the information needed for a portfolio:
- A resume
- A LinkedIn profile
- A list of roles, skills, and projects

What they often don’t have is the time or clarity to turn that information into a presentable site.

I built this project to explore a straightforward question:

**What’s the simplest way to go from “I have a resume” to “I have something I can share”?**

## What This Project Is (and Isn’t)

**This project is:**
- Simple and minimal
- Focused on structure and readability
- Easy to understand and update
- Intended as a starting point

**This project is not:**
- A fully customized or design-heavy portfolio
- An advanced portfolio builder
- A replacement for a handcrafted personal website

Those trade-offs are intentional.

---

## What I Optimized For

- **Clarity** — content is easy to scan
- **Low friction** — minimal setup and decisions
- **Logical structure** — sections align with how recruiters read profiles
- **Maintainability** — easy to update as experience changes

The UI is deliberately restrained so the content carries the weight.

## Try It Yourself

This project is best understood by interacting with it.

You can test the current version here:

The experience focuses on structure and flow rather than advanced visuals.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Modern CSS

The stack supports the goal: reliable, simple, and easy to extend.

## How This Could Evolve

Some directions worth exploring:
- Resume upload and basic parsing
- Multiple layout options from the same data
- Optional visual enhancements
- Feedback based on recruiter interaction

These were intentionally out of scope for this version.

## Why This Is in My GitHub

This project reflects how I approach work:
- Define the minimum useful outcome
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Ship something usable
- Improve based on real feedback

It’s intentionally modest — and intentionally finished.
